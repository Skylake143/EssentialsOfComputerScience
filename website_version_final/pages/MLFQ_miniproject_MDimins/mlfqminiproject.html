    <!--Important introduction-->
    <p id="important">This page allows you to explore the Multi Level Feedback Queue algorithm in action by giving inputs to a C++ program that simulates the MLFQ algorithm in action. In this website further below you can find an online compiler that already contains the C++ program. Before you try it, there are a few things you should know that you can read about in the quick guide.</p>

                <p class="para">
                    You can give the input for the MLFQ algorithm to process in two ways: using "Stdin Inputs" or "Interactive mode". "Stdin Inputs" allows
                    you to type in your input before executing the program and then the console will only print the output. Meanwhile, "Interactive mode" removes
                    the option to type in input before executing the program, and, therefore, you must type in the input directly into the console. It is recommended
                    to use "Stdin Inputs" the first few times as you get familiar with the program.

                <p class="para">
                    This is an overview of what your input for the program should look like. Every "[ ] entry will be replaced by numbers,
                    but these numbers have to be written in a particular order as each position refers to a different "metric" by which the process is described.
                    Each "[ ]" entry is explained separately below.

                <p class="para">
                    At the start of your input, you have to indicate how many processes will enter the Multi Level Feedback Queue,
                    after which you will describe each process separately using numbers. If you write "5", you will have to describe 5 processes that will then be executed
                    using the MLFQ algorithm.

                    "Process ID" indicates, which process this is.
                    If you wrote that there will be 5 processes entering the Multi-Level Feedback Queue,
                    then they have to be numbered from 1 to 5. This means that in the first row,
                    the first number is "1", in the second row, the first number is "2" and so on.

                    "Arrival Time" is the time when the process enters the queue and is ready to be executed. Lowest value is 0,
                     meaning that when you execute the program, the process will already be somewhere in the Multi-Level Feedback Queue.

                    "Process Priority" measures how important the process is. Depending on its priority, it will be placed in the Multi-Level Feedback
