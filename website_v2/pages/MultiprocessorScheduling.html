    <h2>What is it? Approaches, and Problems</h2>
    <p>Multiprocessor Scheduling is a system with multiple CPUs that run in parallel, often using multithreading.</p>
    <p>Some main issues that arise in Multiprocessor Scheduling are Cache Affinity, Cache Coherence, and Load Imbalance.
      Cache Affinity is when the processor cache has accumulated some amount of the process state, i.e., data or instructions. Cache affinity is exploited by OS schedulers: they tend to reschedule processes to run on a recently used processor. 
      Cache Coherence is when shared data resources end up stored in multiple CPU caches. When CPUs in a multiprocessing system maintain caches of a common memory resource, problems may arise with incoherent data.
      Load Imbalance is when one queue finishes faster then other therefore, the load of CPUs is imbalanced. A quick way to solve this issue is through Job Migration.</p>
    <p>SQMS is an approach that reuses basic framework for single CPU scheduling by using a single queue for all the jobs. It has the pro of simplicity, and just needs to adapt its existing policy to work on mulitple CPUs. 
      However, it has cons of scalability due to locking the code, which reduces performance due to the system spending more time on lock overhead.
      It also has a con of cache affinity because jobs bounce from CPU to CPU.
      Each job runs for a time slice, and then another job is chosen.SQMS has affintiy mechanisms to make process more likely to continue on the same CPU. However the scheduler may move other jobs around to balance the load.
      This is known as affinity fairness, migrating different jobs once at a time. </p> 
      <p>MQMS is another approach where jobs are divided in multiple queues with paricular scheduling discipline, ie one per CPU. Some advantages include: 
      scalability, no lock and cache contention issues.
      However, it has the disadvantage of load imbalance. The solution to this problem is to migrate a job from one CPU to another with work stealing.
      A source queue peks at another target queue to see how full it is, if target queue more full than source queue then the soruce steals one or more jobs from the target queue to balance the load. </p>

    <h4>Matrix Multiplication and Deadlock Programs</h4>
      <p> 
        To demonstrate how to design a program using multiple CPUs, we created a Matrix Multiplication program. This was beneficial since in matrix multiplicaiton, the multiplication of every single line of the calculated matrix could be assigned to a thread. To actually benefit from using multiple CPUs we needed to use C++ instead of the previously learned Python, because Pythons implementation does not actually use multiple CPUs. To use multiple CPUs and later on compare the runtime differences of single- and multithreading, we use the programming language C++ using the pthreads library. How to create threads using pthreads will be explained in the following chapter.
