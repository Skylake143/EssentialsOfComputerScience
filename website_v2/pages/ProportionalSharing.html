    <h2>What is it? Approaches, and Concepts</h2>

    <p> The basic concept is tickets representing your share and that
      processes are scheduled in a random manner. Tickets are used to represent the share of a resource that a process should receive.
      Every process has some tickets and a scheduler picks a random ticket. The process having that ticket is the winner and is therefore executed. Then another ticket is picked by the scheduler.
      A process that has a higher number of tickets has a greater chance of getting chosen for execution. For example, 
        let’s say we have two processes A and B having 60 and 40 tickets respectively out of total 100 tickets. CPU share of A is 60% and that of B is 40%.
        Scheduler picks a random number from 1 to 100. If the picked no. is from 1 to 60 then A is executed otherwise B is executed.</p>

    <p>Ticket Mechanisms are used with Ticket Currency
      For example, assume users A and B have each been given 100 tickets.
      User A is running two jobs, A1 and A2, and gives them each 500 tickets (out of 1000 total) in A’s currency.
      User B is running only 1 job and gives it 10 tickets (out of 10 total).
      The system converts A1’s and A2’s allocation from 500 each in A’s currency to 50 each in the global currency;
      similarly, B1’s 10 tickets is converted to 100 tickets. The lottery is then held over the global ticket currency (200 total) to determine which job runs. </p> 

    <p>Probably the most amazing thing about lottery scheduling is the simplicity of its implementation.
       All you need is a good random number generator to pick the winning ticket, a data structure to track the processes of the system (e.g., a list), and the total number of tickets.
       An Example: Two jobs, each 100 tickets, competing with one another, </p>

       <ul>
       <li>R - run time</li> 
  
        <li>U - unfairness metric (time it takes for job 1 to complete divided by time it takes for job 2)</li>

       </ul>
       
  
 <p> We aim for the unfairness metric value to be equal to 1 (both jobs complete in the same amount of time).
  An important thing to note is that over short periods of run time the unfairness metric tends to severely differ from 1,
  so to reach the desired fairness, the run time needs to be extended</p>

  <p>The ticket-assignment problem, (how tickets should be assigned to specific jobs) is a question with no general answer.
    One approach is to give the control to distribute tickets directly to the user for he is the one that SHOULD know how to divide them best.
    However there is no optimal answer to this problem as it’s dependent on the specifics of the tasks.</p>

  <p> <strong> Randomness</strong> poses the risk of unfair scheduling over short periods of time. For this a <strong> Deterministic</strong> approach is preferred.
      Stride scheduling - we take an inverse of the assigned ticket value (f.e. a large number divided by each job’s amount of tickets, or sum of the tickets diveded by individual job’s tickets) and call it a stride of each process.
      For each time a job runs, its pass value (being its countermeasure, equal to the value of stride) is increased.
      The job with the smallest value of pass value is the one to run next.
      However, it is not suitable for newly added jobs as their pass value is unclear.</p>

      <p>The Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) is used to achieve the CPU’s maximum efficiency, meaning that ideally all processes should get (100/N)% CPU time.
        This ensures that no time should be wasted on switching processes.
        CFS is different from other schedulers. Other schedulers operate their processes on fixed time,
        while CFS divides all the processes through a counting based technique known as runtime.
        CFS’s use of data structures like Red-Black binary trees, allow it to very efficient in switching processes.
        CFS will pick a process with the least vruntime every scheduling decision.
        This makes this scheduler more fair compared to other schedulers.</p>
